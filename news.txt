Guys! Recently, telegram has started to slow down with frequent frequency, apparently Durov has completely decided to give up on our country and does not update the equipment! I heard from knowledgeable guys that they recently created a cool new messenger (they say telegram is better), and so far no one is allowed in there, beta test or something like that. If you can rock it, then rock it, it's not just the developers who get high from it)
